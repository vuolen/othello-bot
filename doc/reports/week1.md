# Week 1

This week has mostly comprised of planning my project and creating the [template and API](https://github.com/vuolen/othello-core) for an Othello bot. The project is going along nicely. I hope the template does not take away too much time from this and other courses, thankfully it is quite simple.

Next I'd like to implement the core of the minimax algorithm while making sure the code is clear and easy to expand upon. I'd also like to finish the template.

I spent approximately 3 hours on the course this week.
