# Week 5

This week I feel like the project is nearly finished. There wasn't much to do. I updated some of the testing documentation and added some tests to the static evaluator. The test coverage is pretty high now. I also fixed a minor bug, but thats really all.

I tried optimizing the algorithm for a couple of hours, but couldn't achieve anything significant that I could measure.

This week I spent 3 hours on the project.
