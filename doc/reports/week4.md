# Week 3

This week the core of the bot is pretty much finished. The only thing subject to change is the static evaluator, which can always be improved. Left to do now is optimization, documentation and increasing test coverage.

I implemented a rendition of the final static evaluator and refactored it to its own package and interface, which makes it easier to compose different bots by switching their evaluator function.

I started on the testing document, implementation document and performance tests.

I spent approximately 10 hours on the course this week.
